                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead"><br><strong>                  by Walter Sneader
</strong><br>The road ahead was disappearing as the mist came down, thicker and thicker. Combined with fading light, it offered a considerable challenge for my driving skills. Undaunted, I forged ahead as best I could. But after a further 20 minutes I began to worry that I might have to abandon my plans. Suddenly, without warning, the car hit a large pothole. There was a sickening crunch from the front suspension. And that was the end of my journey. There was no way I could continue. Worse still, there was not a signal on my phone that would allow me to summon help.
<br>
<br>
<br>When I switched off the headlights, it was very dark. I stepped out the vehicle and looked around, but could not make out anything. When my eyes eventually became accustomed to the darkness, I spotted a lonely cottage about 400 yards to my left. I immediately headed for it. With considerable disappointment I realised there were no lights or any other sign of life.
<br><br>The door was on the side of the cottage. To my surprise, it swung open when I knocked. I did not enter at that point. Instead I shouted,
<br>“Anyone at home? My car has broken down.”
<br>Receiving no reply, I stepped inside. If there was a light switch, I could not find it. Instead, I took out my phone and turned on its feeble light. I was in a small room with a wooden table and four chairs. The only other furnishing was a Dutch dresser.
<br><br>Cautiously, I entered the other room. It was slightly larger, with a single bed. In front of the opposite wall was an old-fashioned bath mounted on small legs. It was half filled with water. Something was soaking in it.  when I turned the light to make out more detail, I was shocked to discover it was a body! 
<br><br>When I had eventually recovered my composure, I could see that the body was that of a fully clothed young man. There was no sign of life. I could not believe my own eyes. With growing panic, I hurriedly checked out the rest of the room. There was something lying on the chair. It was small. A gun. My stomach turned.
<br>
<br>A moment later, I heard a strange noise from above me. At first, I thought it was a bird. But the whirring noise was too mechanical. Pointing my torch upwards, I saw that there was something hovering above me. I think it was some sort of mechanical device, with a flashing red light. It was about 18 inches wide, of square shape. Then suddenly I was temporarily blinded by a small spotlight mounted on the hovering object. An artificial voice booked out at me,
<br>“Remain where you are! Do not move. You are trespassing.”
<br>
<br>This was the last straw. My heart was pounding. What was I to do? I decided wisdom was the best part of valour. I froze. In more senses than one.
<br><br>About ten minutes later, I heard a car driving up to the cottage. Two men got out and I could hear what they were saying,
<br>“Hope this isn’t another of those false alarms, The damn drone is far too sensitive. It picks up everything, even mice running about.”
<br>“Aye. We’ll have to get it adjusted. This is the third time it’s called us out. Pretty annoying,” replied the second voice.
<br>
<br>Two men entered the cottage. The dining room first. I was shaking all over. I was about to be their next victim! I could sense the door opening as they entered the room I was in.
<br><br>A powerful torch was pointed at me.
<br>“Who the hell are you?” demanded the torch bearer.
<br>“I, I am the driver of a car that has broken down.”
<br>“Really? And you thought you’d just have a look round the cottage.”
<br>“I meant no harm. The door was unlocked. Nobody answered when I rang the bell, so ii came in. That’s all.”
<br>“A likely story. I bet you came deliberately to see what was here.”
<br>Then I remembered the body in the bath. Somehow these two men must have been responsible. I was in deep trouble. <br>
<br>Glancing around, I could just make out the doorway, I was nearer to it than either of my interrogators. Could I make a dash for it? I did. With no further hesitation, I darted out the room and headed for the cottage door. I managed to escape but the two thugs were in hot pursuit. I ran as fast as my legs would take me, hoping the darkness might save me. But I forgot about the pothole that had ruined the suspension of my car. My left foot went straight in to another one. I fell heavily.
<br>
<br>“Ok, smart Alex. You didn’t imagine you’d get away. Did you? I’m going to have to call the cops. You’re in real trouble!”
<br>
<br>I thought fast.
<br>“You wouldn’t dare. Not with that body in the bath!”
<br>He grabbed my arm and pulled me back to the cottage. This time it was lit up. I was taken in to the room with the bath. To my horror, my captor bent over it and pulled the corpse out.
<br>“What are you doing? ” I yelled.
<br>He grabbed the corpse and hoisted it up. He threw it at me. I caught it grimly, feeling utterly stupid when I realised that it was an inflatable doll! 
<br>“Didn’t you know that you had trespassed into a film set?”
<br>I realised how stupid I had been.
<br>“Are you still going to call the police?” I asked nervously.
<br>“Don’t be daft. The nearest constable lives nearly forty miles from here. He wouldn’t take kindly to our pestering him so late at night. Away you go!”
<br>
<br>
<br>
